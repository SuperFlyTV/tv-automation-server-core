# Sofie: Additional Packages

A Sofie system is made up of multiple components.

This folder houses a yarn workspace with various integration libraries, and gateways that are part of the functionality that sofie offers.

The libraries are referenced by core directly, so should behave the same as if `npm link` was used.

There are a few commands defined at this level to do operations on the libraries in parallel.

Each package has its own README explaining its purpose and usage.
